        From challenging myself to master knitting to learning complex
        programming concepts and languages, I find immense joy in mastering new
        skills and expanding my <span class="aqua">breadth</span> and

      <h3>So, who are you really?</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in upstate New York surrounded by nature and a small, familiar
        town. Over time my <span class="dark-aqua">curious nature</span> led me
        to technology, and I've never looked back. However, I also hold an equal
        passion for art, which I also continuously work to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
        In high school I pursued a rigorous
        <a
          href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/"
          target="_blank"
          >IB diploma</a
        >
        to get a headstart in college, and walked away with
        <span class="dark-aqua">56 college credits</span> and a
        <span class="dark-aqua">101.1 GPA</span>. In addition, I began my
        journey of student leadership and managing a challenging workload on top
        of maintaining hobbies that I enjoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am studying computer science in Univerisity with an
        expected graduation date of <span class="dark-aqua">Fall 2024</span>. I
        work as a lab assistant and peer teacher for Intro to CS. Additionally,
        I am a student in the
        <a href="https://cyberresearchgroup.org/" target="_blank"
          >Virtual Institute of Cyber Operation and Research (VICOR)</a
        >
        program with the Department of Defense. In my spare time I love
        tinkering with new skills, working on passion projects, creating art,
        reading fantasty novels, and watching other people play video games.
