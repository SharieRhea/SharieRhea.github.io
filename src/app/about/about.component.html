  <h2>So, who are you really?</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      I grew up in upstate New York surrounded by nature and small, familiar town. Over time my <i>curious nature</i> has led me to try a plethora of hobbies including:
      digital and traditional art, reading, knitting, crocheting, hiking, skiing, powerlifting, and riding motorcycles. While my motivation for many of these activities
      ebbs and flows, my one constant passion has always been <i>problem-solving</i>. Programming exercises this in a way that no other hobby can. From building mobile
      apps to applying algorithms and data structures, the thrill of solving a tough coding challenge never gets old.

      In high school I pursued a rigorous <a href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/" target="_blank">International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma</a> to
      get a head start in college. I walked away with <i>53 college credits</i> and a 101.1 GPA. In addition, I began my journey of student leadership and managing a
      challenging workload on top of maintaining the hobbies I enjoy.

      I graduated from <a href="https://www.albany.edu/" target="_blank">SUNY Albany</a> in December 2024 with a <i>B.S. in Computer Science, summa cum laude</i>. I
      also participated in the  <a href="https://www.viceroyscholars.org/" target="_blank"> Virtual Institutes for Cyber and Electromagnetic Spectrum Research and
      Employ (VICEROY)</a> program with the Department of Defense. Thanks to this program I was able to intern with the Griffiss Institute and Air Force Research
      Laboratory (AFRL) during the summer of 2024. Additionally, as a VICEROY MAVEN distinguished graduate, I had the amazing opportunity to visit the <i>Pentagon</i>.

      I am currently employed full time as an <i>Associate Research Computer Scientist</i>.
