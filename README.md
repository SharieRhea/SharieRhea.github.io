# sharierhea.dev 

Hi there! The site is currently under maintenance, I'm using the space below to keep track of TODOs and necessary updates.

## General TODOs

- [ ] check accessibility for pretty much everything
- [ ] refactor all css to better utilize the main styles.css file

## Visual TODOs

- [ ] find images/take screenshots
- [ ] allow switching to light theme

## Ideas

- [ ] add subtle animations (fade or slide in for project cards)
- [ ] allow filtering projects by technologies (by clicking on them from a card?)
- [ ] clicking on a technology icon expands it to show its name (toggles)

## Deployment

To deploy the site using `angular-cli-ghpages` use `ng deploy`. This will create an auto-generated commit to the `gh-pages` branch. Make sure that build branch for ghpages is set to the `gh-pages` branch!
