# sharierhea.dev 

## TODO

- [X] port over all project descriptions 
- [ ] find images/take screenshots

- [ ] allow clicking on a project card to lead to the project's showcase page

- [ ] resize project title on mobile to be smaller
- [ ] fix text vertical alignment on project link buttons
- [X] add technology name to button on project showcase

- [X] add project cards to desktop view, 2 side-by-side

## Ideas

- [ ] recreate the text "decode" effect on "SHARIE RHEA"
- [ ] add subtle animations (fade or slide in for project cards)
- [ ] allow filtering projects by technologies (by clicking on them from a card?)
- [ ] allow switching to light theme
- [ ] clicking on a technology icon expands it to show its name (toggles)
